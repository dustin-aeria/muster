---

### Q230: What declaration type is needed for sRPAS BVLOS over sparsely populated area?
**A:** **Pre-Validated Declaration (PVD)** - Because small RPAS BVLOS less than 1km from populated area or over sparsely populated requires PVD.

---

### Q231: What declaration type is needed for sRPAS VLOS in controlled airspace?
**A:** **Standard Declaration** (922.04 compliance)

---

### Q232: What declaration type is needed for mRPAS VLOS near people (<500ft)?
**A:** **Pre-Validated Declaration (PVD)** - Medium RPAS near people requires 922.07 compliance.

# PART 12: ADVANCED SORA SCENARIOS

---

### Q233: A 2m multirotor operates at 15 m/s over suburban area (3,000 ppl/km²). What is the iGRC?
**A:** Using the iGRC table:
- Dimension: 1-3m category
- Speed: <35 m/s
- Population: <5,000 ppl/km² (suburban)
**iGRC = 6**

---

### Q234: Can M1(A) Sheltering reduce GRC for outdoor assembly overflights?
**A:** **NO** - M1(A) Sheltering is not applicable when overflying large open assemblies.

---

### Q235: What is the Final GRC if iGRC=6 with M2 High robustness applied?
**A:** **Final GRC = 4** (iGRC 6 - 2 for M2 High = 4)

---

### Q236: What SAIL results from Final GRC 4 and ARC-b?
**A:** **SAIL III**

---

### Q237: For SAIL III, what robustness is required for OSO #08 (Operational Procedures)?
**A:** **High robustness** - OSO #08 requires High at SAIL III and above.

---

### Q238: Calculate the adjacent area outer limit for a UA with max speed 30 m/s.
**A:**
```
Distance = Speed × 3 minutes
Distance = 30 m/s × 180 s = 5,400 m = 5.4 km
```
Since this is between 5km (min) and 35km (max), use **5.4 km**.

---

### Q239: What grid size should be used for population density mapping at 1,000 ft AGL operations?
**A:** **>400 × 400 m** (per SORA Table 4)

---

### Q240: What is the maximum VLOS distance for a 2m rotorcraft?
**A:**
```
ALOS = 327 × 2 + 20 = 674m
DLOS = 1,500m (with 5km visibility)
VLOS limit = 674m
```
